# 👋 Hi, I'm Lakmal

🎞️ I'm a passionate **video editor** with a growing love for building creative tools to support my workflow.

While I don't have a background in programming, I've started using **ChatGPT** to bring my ideas to life — turning workflows into real apps without writing a single line of code by myself.

## 🧠 What I’m Doing

- ✂️ I edit promotional videos, intros/outros, logo reveals, and more
- 🤖 I'm exploring **AI-assisted app development** to solve real problems I face during editing
- 💻 I recently built [Tutorial Manager App](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tutorial-manager-app) — a desktop app to organize and preview editing tutorials from local files or the web, using **Python + Tkinter + ChatGPT**
- 💡 I come up with ideas, explain the workflow to ChatGPT, and build step-by-step with its help

## 🛠 Tools I Use

- 🎬 Adobe Premiere Pro & After Effects
- 🎨 Photoshop, Illustrator
- 🌐 ChatGPT (for creative coding)
- 🐍 Python (with AI guidance)

## 💡 Projects I’m Building

- 🧰 A personal **Creative Asset Organizer** to manage fonts, stock videos, overlays, and music
- 🎵 A tool to **match music tracks by mood and tempo** (great for editors!)
- 📚 An all-in-one **Tutorial Tracker** to manage online/offline learning resources
- 💬 Real-time client collaboration tools for editors

All powered by **AI-assisted app development** with ChatGPT. If you're curious about this process — feel free to reach out or fork my projects!

## 🚀 My Goal

To prove that **any creative person** can build tools — with the right help. You don’t need to be a coder to build something awesome. You just need an idea, some curiosity, and a bit of AI ✨
